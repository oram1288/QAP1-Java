1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep 
try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual 
part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

- Where i was late starting it and pressed for time a bit i worked on this one for 
3-4 days straight and roughly 4 hours each day, doing a problem every day.

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

- I used the lectures and Youtube videos as resources to help me.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, 
please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

- No.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many 
questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

- No.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of each question from your own perspective, 
and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem 
requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

- Didn't find the QAP too bad, just took a bit of time to figure things out. Problem 3
was probably the trickiest.
